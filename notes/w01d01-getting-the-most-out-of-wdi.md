# How to Get the Most out of WDI

## 1. Adopt a positive attitude

The way we think, and the language we use, has an effect on how we learn. WDI is a highly intensive learning experience. It's a bit like climbing a mountain with a heavy backpack. The backpack contains all the things that you do that are detrimental to the learning experience.

By adopting a positive mental attitude, you can effectively lighten the load. Let's look at some examples:

> I just can't do it.

> She's so much better than me, what chance do I have.

> I would've **never** got that in a million years.

> I'm so confused.

> I'm lost.

> I'm useless.

All of the above thoughts are negative. When we think in this way, our subconscious mind takes it on board as the truth, and this affects our mood, making us feel tired, confused and ashamed.

By changing the way we think, we can lift our spirits, which will make us feel more positive and more able to tackle the challenges that face us. Let's re-write the thoughts above in a more positive way:

> This is really challenging, but it'll be so great when I have got a handle on it.

> Wow, look at Sarah go! I should make friends with her!

> I'm not 100% sure of this, but I know in time it will make more sense.

> I'm a little out of my depth, I should concentrate and ask questions to help me understand.

> Most people seem to be picking this up. That's great, I should be able to find lots of people who can help me understand.

**This is by far the most effective tool for getting the most out of this course.**

## 2. Be smart

There is a fine line between asking questions and being self-sufficient.

During this course you will be exposed to *a lot* of new concepts and material. There is a tendency to want to understand everything before moving on. While this is logical, it is a bad approach for this course. A better approach is to take things at face value, and allow things to *wash over you*. Often a concept seems confusing at first, but when you put it into practice, it becomes more clear.

I like to use the analogy of a microwave. Most people, when first introduced to a microwave want to know *how* to use it. They very rarely ask *why* it works in the way that it does. Ask yourself, do you know how a microwave works? Probably not. If you did know, do you think it would help you to *use* the microwave? Probably not.

A lot of junior developers think that they should know everything, because at some stage they are going to be looking for work. Do you think that a chef understands how a microwave works? Do you think that Jamie Oliver would ask a prospective employee how a microwave works during an interview? It's unlikely.

Ask questions to help *clarify* things during lectures. Ask questions to help *understand* things during exercises. You want to focus on *how* to make things work, not *why* they work on this course.

**Do not ask the same question over and over**. If you ask us how to do a simple task, we will tell you. If you ask us a second time, we will tell you to use Google to find the answer. This is not because we are impatient, it is because we want you to be *self-sufficient*. **Developers who rely on themselves are more likely to stay in work than those that rely on others.**

Keep a notebook to make a note of things that you often forget.

Finally, while your instructors may seem like fonts of all knowledge, there are many other places to get help and advice:

* Your teaching assistants
* Online forums ([stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/community) are particularly good)
* Other WDI students around campus
* Your peers

## 3. Look after yourself

12 weeks of intensive learning is a slog. You will need to be focused and attentive throughout those 12 weeks if you want to get the most from this course. The following tips will help you keep up with the pace, both physically and mentally:

1. **Eat healthily:** It's very tempting to reach out for chocolate, sugary sweets, coffee and alcohol for support when the going gets tough. While this may help in the short term, over the course of 12 weeks it will make you lethargic and despondent. Stick to slow-release energy foods and drinks like fruit, water and cereals. Keep your alcohol intake moderate.

2. **Get a decent amount of sleep:** Sleeping and dreaming are an important part of the learning process. In order to absorb as much as possible, as quickly as possible aim to get a decent night's sleep every night. To help with this, shut your laptop an hour before you go to bed, so you have chance to switch off fully.

3. **Manage your time effectively over the weekend:** You should allow yourself *at least* eight hours coding time over the weekend. You may think its best to take a break on Saturday, but its probably best to start the weekend challenge on Saturday morning (after a lie in of course). This means if you run out of time, you *still* have the Sunday to work on the problem at hand. **Don't start asking for help on Sunday evening!** You probably won't get any!

4. **Exercise:** You will not have a lot of free time, but you should do some form of exercise. You'll be using your brain all week, so it's important to re-connect with your body throughout the course.

## 4. Be competent with your machine

Some of you will not have used a computer much before. Some of you may be more used to a Windows machine than a Mac. If that is the case, make sure you take the time to get to know as many shortcuts as possible. A big part of the course is coding along with the instructor. If you slip behind, it can get frustrating, so you need to be efficient with your typing skills.

Learning to touch type whilst on the course is not an option. Your typing speed and accuracy will naturally increase over the next 12 weeks, but the simplest way of upping you typing game is with shortcuts. Learn them, love them, but most of all *use them!*

## 5. Make friends with your peers

Making friends with fellow coders is a must. The more people you know in this industry the better. If you think you are smarter than everyone else, or you think you are dumber than everyone else, you will struggle.

Coding is complex and nuanced. Solving problems is difficult. Think about a problem that human beings have solved. Let's take air travel as an example. Think for a moment how many people are involved in creating, maintaining and flying passengers around the world. Its mind-boggling. If human beings didn't collaborate, air travel would not be possible.

One of the key-skills of being a good web-developer is being a good **communicator** and a good **collaborator**.

If someone asks you for help, help them. Even if you aren't sure yourself, *especially* if you aren't sure yourself, give them your time and try to help them work through the problem. Even if you don't come up with a solution together, you will have developed communication and collaboration skills.

## 6. Be on time

When you arrive to a session late, you disrupt others. You disrupt the instructor, you disrupt your peers and you miss out on important information. Once a session has started instructors will not repeat themselves. If you are late, you may be asked to sit out the session.

## 7. Be focused

During a session, there may be some time when you have nothing to do. Your instructor may be helping others, or she may be dealing with a technical issue of her own. Use this time wisely. **Do not spend this time on Facebook or Youtube, checking your emails or buying stuff on Amazon.** It shows disrespect to your instructional team, and your peers. Instead, use the time to asses and digest what has been taught, and to offer assistance to your peers if suitable.

## 8. Have fun

Inject as much fun in your work as possible. If you like Vines of cats on hoovers, then by all means include them in your projects and challenges. The more engaged you are with the stuff you are producing, the more enjoyable your time on this course will be. Also, the more that your portfolio reflects your personality, the more likely your are to find a job to match.

So work hard, but don't forget to have fun along the way!
